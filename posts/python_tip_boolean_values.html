                <h1>Conditional statements and objects boolean values</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This post is not intended to discuss in depth the concepts of truthiness of objects in Python, 
                    although I hope to write about this in a dedicated post in the future.
                    Instead, it is intended to be a short reminder of a useful trick when writing condidtional statements 
                    involving sequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enough discussion, let's talk about the trick!
                </p>
                <h2>The trick</h2>
                <p>
                    When we write
                    <pre><code>    if &ltcondition&gt</code></pre>
                    Python tries to evaluate the boolean value corresponding to the <code>&ltcondition&gt</code> expression.
                    To do this, it calls the <code>__bool__</code> method of the object returned by the  <code>&ltcondition&gt</code> expression.
                    Remember that everything is an object in Python, which means that whatever this expression is, it returns an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What happens then is that the <code>__bool__</code> method returns either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
                    depending on the way it is implemented in the class this object is an instance of; when should an instance of 
                    this object considered <code>True</code> and when should one be considered <code>False</code>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what happens for objects in which the <code>__bool__</code> method is implemented. But what happens when it is not implemented?
                    In this case, the <code>__len__</code> method is called, if it is implemented.  
                    As its name indicates, this method simply returns the 
                    length of the sequence. If the <code>__len__</code> method is not implemented either,
                    then the object's truth value defaults to <code>True</code>, unless the object is <code>None</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of Python sequences, the <code>__bool__</code> function is not implemented so the truth value is determined
                    by the value returned by the <code>__len__</code> method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, why is this interesting?
                    The reason this is interesting for us is due to the way the truth value of an integer is determined. It's very simple:
                    if the integer is equal to zero, then it evaluates to <code>False</code>. If it is not equal to zero, then it evaluates
                    to <code>True</code>. This fact, coupled with the fact that the <code>None</code> singleton object always evaluates to 
                    <code>False</code> is all we need for our little trick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what's the trick then? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's consider how we would typically use a sequence we want to retrieve elements from. The first thing we would do, before
                    doing whatever it is we want to do, is write the following code:
                    <pre><code>    if my_sequence is not None and len(my_sequence) > 0:
        # do whatever we want to do
                    </code></pre>
                    We first test if the sequence is not equal to None - or more accurately, we test if its memory address is not the same as that 
                    of the singleton <code>None</code> object via the <code>is</code> operator. Once this is out of the way, we make sure the sequence
                    actually contains elements. Finally, we do what we originally wanted to do with the sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are still awake after this tedious explanation, you noticed something: this is a lot of boilerplate code to write just
                    to make sure we can use our sequence the way God intended to. This is where our trick kicks in. Instead of writing this code,
                    we simply write:
                    <pre><code>    if my_sequence:
        # do whatever we want to do
                    </code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now why can we do that? Simply because, as we discussed, in order to determine the truth value associated to our <code>my_sequence</code>
                    object, Python will call its <code>__len__</code> method. Now there are actually 3 things that can happen here:
                    <ol>
                        <li>For some reason <code>my_sequence</code> is actually <code>None</code></li>
                        <li><code>my_sequence</code> is not <code>None</code> and is of length zero</li>
                        <li><code>my_sequence</code> is not <code>None</code> and is of length greater than zero</li>
                    </ol>
                    In the first case, because <code>my_sequence</code> is equal to the <code>None</code> object which has truth value <code>False</code>, <code>my_sequence</code>
                    will evaluate to <code>False</code>. In the second case, the <code>__len__</code> function will return the value zero which will be 
                    evaluated to <code>False</code>. In the third case, the <code>__len__</code> function will return a non-zero integer which will
                    evaluate to <code>True</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Said differently, <code>my_sequence</code> will only evaluate to <code>True</code> if it is not <code>None</code> and if it has 
                    length superior to zero. This allows us to write a shorter expression and make sure we check both conditions in the right order.
                </p>
